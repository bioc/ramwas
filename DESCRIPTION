Description: RaMWAS provides a complete toolset for methylome-wide
        association studies (MWAS). It is specifically designed for
        data from enrichment based methylation assays, but can be
        applied to other methylomic data as well. The analysis pipeline
        includes seven steps: (1) scanning aligned reads from BAM
        files, (2) calculation of quality control measures, (3)
        creation of methylation score (coverage) matrix, (4) principal
        component analysis for capturing batch effects and detection of
        outliers, (5) association analysis with respect to phenotypes
        of interest while correcting for top PCs and known covariates,
        (6) annotation of significant findings, and (7) multi-marker
        analysis (methylation risk score) using elastic net.
